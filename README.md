# Welcome to my React Parallax demo!

Hello and welcome to my tech demo for a react parallax application. In this demonstration you will learn how to do a traditional parallax image, a reversed parallax image, a blur parallax image, and a layered parallax scene.

Parallax itself is a distortion of view in the simplest of explanations. It can be visually impactful when used on websites and can create the illusion of movement when using parallax layers

## Packages

In order to create and run the applications, you will need to install a few packages. First, you will need to install vite to instigate a development server:

```
    npm create vite@latest
```

After this you will need to follow the steps on screen. For this project I selected React as the framework adnd JavaScript + SWC as the variant.

Next you will need to install react parallax:

```
    npm i react-parallax
```

You will also need to install react spring parallax:

```
    npm i @react-spring/parallax
```

This version of parallax is the one that will allow you to create a layered version of parallax.

## Setting up the demo

As you have now created a new react file, you can remove all unnecessary files and components. All of the content in the CSS files may be deleted, as well as all of the content within the App function, and any react images.

In addition, you will need to select some images (either your own or off of the internet) to use as your demonstration images. I selected mine as clear pictures (without filters) from [Unsplash] (https://unsplash.com/). Ideally you will want to choose images that are landscape.

You will also want to select some png images that can be layered atop on of the other images that you have selected to create a scene. I would suggest at least four png images.

The demo itself is a Single Page Application that routes to four pages:

1. The first page that the users can navigate to provides an example of parallax in which the image is fixed to the background making the containers layered above it move when the user scrolls down.
2. The second page navigates to an example of parallax where the scroll is reversed. Essentially, when the user scrolls down, the image moves in the opposite direction.
3. The third form of parallax demonstrates layered parallax images to give that animated feel - similar to the Firewatch game website.
4. The fourth and final demonstration of parallax is in relation to mouse movement. Here the layers try to 'outrun' the users mouse.

The demo that I have created routes to different pages using react-dom routing but that is an optional function.

## General Parallax

The first thing that you are going to want to do is create a div that will sit above the first parallax image. This is because parallax only works if the page is scrollable, at least for these types of parallax. These are the steps that you should take to use react-parallax to create the image that appears on the homepage.

1. Make sure that you have imported your package into the file that you are working in e.g.

```
import { Parallax } from "react-parallax";
```

and import the image that you would like to use Ä“.g.

```
import ParallaxImage from 'image path'
```

2. Create and export a function for the image e.g. ScrollParallax
3. Create a div within the function that will sit above the image (you can change the height of the div either in CSS or in the div itself by setting the style).
4. Within the return function create another div and give it a classname to identify it e.g. parallaxContainer and within that div write

```
<Parallax>
    <div></div>
</Parallax>
```

5. You likely will not be able to see anything yet. Next you want to add code within the Parallax tag to add the background image, and set the strength of the parallax. You are welcome to change the strength and play around with it, just note that once you reach a certain point the image will lag.

```
<Parallax bgImage={name of imported background image} strength={400}>
    <div></div>
</Parallax>
```

6. Next, you will want to edit the div that is within the Parallax tags to set the height of the image.

```
<Parallax bgImage={Image} strength={400}>
    <div style={{height: 700, width: "cover"}}></div>
</Parallax>
```

In this instance we have set the ehight to be 700 pixels and the width of the image to cover the width of the page. 7. (Optional) You can also add a div after your parallax div to further witness the parallax effect as it allows for further scrolling.

## Reverse Parallax

The second type of parallax demonstrated here is reverse parallax. Essentially, it uses the same concept as the previous parallax, just with the image going in the opposite direction. As such the steps are essentially the same.

1. Follow steps 1-7 of the General Parallax section but change the strength compnent to a negative number e.g.

```
<Parallax bgImage={Image} strength={-200}>
    <div style={{height: 700, width: "cover"}}></div>
</Parallax>
```

This negative strength changes the direction that the image moves.

## Blur Parallax

Blur parallax follows essentially the same steps as the previous two, except with another element added to the main image.

1. Follow steps 1-7 of the General Parallax section but add the parameter blur e.g.

```
<Parallax blur={{min: -25, max: 35}} bgImage={image} bgImageAlt="image alt" strength={150}>
    <div style={{height: 700, width: "cover", margin: "auto"}} />
</Parallax>
```

In this case, the blur function indicates where the blur begins and the speed it appears in relation to the image. You can play around with these numbers based on the image you have used and how you want the blur to appear.

## Layered Parallax

Layered parallax is a little more complex than other forms of parallax that we have used so far. Mostly, this is due to the need to layer the images. For this, I would suggest choosing a simple background that can be built upon.

1. For this version of parallax, you will need to ensure that you have imported the package react-spring parallax

```
import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from "@react-spring/parallax";
```

and that you have imported any layers that you would like to add. In this instance, you may find it easiest to import the png images and name them by the layer that they will be e.g. LayerOne.

2. Create and export a function that describes the type of parallax that you will be using e.g. ScrollParallaxLayered.
3. Within the return statement of that function create a div.
4. Within that div create a Parallax tag that specifies the amount of pages you would like the parallax to span. e.g.

```
<Parallax pages={1.5}>
</Parallax>
```

If you like you can also add a className.

Now we will be creating parallax layers. The order in which you place these layers is important as it will determine the order that the images will appear when you scroll. You want to make sure that the layers that you place first are the ones that you want to appear behind others. Essentially, you are placing the layers in descending order.

Each layer of parallax has four things:

- Offset: The offset refers to the position of the layer on the page. Background is 0 as you want it to be at the top of the first page, 1 if you want it to be at the top of the second page etc
- Speed: The speed that the layer moves in relation to the scrolling
- Factor: The size that the layer appears relative to the size of the page e.g. 1 would be 100%, 2 would be 200% etc
- Style: This is where you add the image, and set the style for the image that you are using e.g. make it cover the page etc.

1. Within the parallax tags create your first layer. This will serve as the background layer of parallax. You will need to include ... It should look something like this:

```
<ParallaxLayer
    offset={0}
    speed={0.5}
    factor={2}
    style={{
        backgroundImage: `url(${BackgroundLayer})`,
        backgroundSize: "cover",
        backgroundPosition: "center",
    }}
/>
```

Please note: You can either do closing tags or add a forward slash at the end of the ParallaxLayer tag. If you are placing text as the layer and not an image, you will need to have a closing tag rather than a /. 
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the layers that you are adding adjusting the offset, speed, factor and style for each of the layers to create your scene. You can add images, text, or any other format allowed by react.

And that's it!

Best of luck!

Welcome to my React Parallax demo!

Here are the steps to running the demo itself:

1. You need to ensure that you have run npm install so that you have react, react-router-dom, react-parallax, and vite up and running.
2. Type npm run dev to get the server up and running.
3. That's it!

The demo itself is a Single Page Application that routes to four pages:

1. The first page that the users can navigate to provides an example of parallax in which the image is fixed to the background making the containers layered above it move when the user scrolls down.
2. The second page navigates to an example of parallax where the scroll is reversed. Essentially, when the user scrolls down, the image moves in the opposite direction.
3. The third form of parallax demonstrates layered parallax images to give that animated feel - similar to the Firewatch game website.
4. The fourth and final demonstration of parallax is in relation to mouse movement. Here the layers try to 'outrun' the users mouse.

And that's it!

Here are some of the documentation surrounding the implementation of the react-parallax component:

Best of luck!
